# 👋 Hello, I’m Himangshu Pan

## **Rustacean** \| **Blockchain Developer** \| **Backend Engineer**

---

Welcome to my personal space on the internet.

I’m a backend engineer and blockchain developer with a strong foundation in Python and an emerging specialization in Rust. My journey began in training, moved through Python-driven data systems, explored blockchain-based digital identity, and has now led me deep into the world of low-level, high-performance Rust development.

From building government digitization projects to launching decentralized apps like **Secret Invoice** on Secret Network, I’ve always been driven by curiosity, real-world impact, and secure software architecture.

## 🔭 Ongoing Mission

I’m currently on a focused path to become a **professional Rust developer**—deep diving into systems programming, memory safety, and decentralized infrastructure. While Rust is slower to compile, its runtime performance and memory guarantees make it ideal for building safe and scalable backends and smart contracts.

As part of this mission, I’ve also started writing **technical blogs** focused on Rust and modern development tools—sharing insights, real-world solutions, and best practices for building fast, safe, and reliable systems. My goal is to contribute to the developer community and help others avoid the pitfalls I’ve faced.
