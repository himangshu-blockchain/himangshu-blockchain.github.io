# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! I’m **Himangshu Pan**, a backend engineer and blockchain developer with a journey rooted in curiosity, self-growth, and a drive to build meaningful software.

## 🛤 My Journey So Far

My career started humbly in education and government service:

- **2015**: I worked as a **contract-based trainer** for the **CCTNS project**—a Government of India initiative to digitize police departments. My role was to train officers in using computer systems and basic software.
- Before that, I was a **faculty member at Unique Computer Academy**, where I taught children the fundamentals of computing and introductory programming.

In **January 2016**, I joined **AQB Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** as a Python developer. Initially, I worked on data analysis projects—configuring crawlers to extract website data and store it in structured databases. I also processed and parsed data from PDFs using Python and related packages. I started actually writing production code after nearly a year of learning and observing.

During this time, I also pursued my **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** certification in 2018 to better understand software vulnerabilities and secure development practices.

## 📘 Teaching & Balancing Life

In parallel with my full-time job, I took up a weekend teaching role at ICSS as a **Python faculty**, which I maintained for six months. Eventually, I had to let it go to restore work-life balance while continuing my full-time development role.

## 🔗 Blockchain Chapter Begins

In **2019**, I joined **Klizo Solutions Pvt. Ltd.** as a full-time Python developer. It was here that I was introduced to blockchain technology—specifically **Hyperledger Indy** and the **Aries framework**. I worked on building a **proof of concept for a decentralized identity system**, where users could receive verifiable credentials and present zero-knowledge proofs to verifiers. This was one of the most challenging and enlightening projects of my career.

## 🌍 Transition to Freelancing

After getting married in 2021, I stepped away from full-time contracts and began my freelancing journey. One of the key projects I worked on was **Secret Invoice**, built on the **Secret Network**—a privacy-focused blockchain. This project was successfully deployed to mainnet.

I also contributed to several other projects that, while not deployed, were valuable learning experiences in decentralized applications, smart contract workflows, and system design.

Additionally, I worked on **Emprops**, a Generative AI + NFT-based project, where I contributed by writing and maintaining **unit tests** to ensure reliability and consistency across the smart contract codebase. It was a unique opportunity to blend testing discipline with cutting-edge blockchain innovation.

## 🦀 Falling in Love with Rust

Freelancing taught me a lot, but the volatility of income, especially with growing family responsibilities, made me reassess my direction. That’s when I discovered **Rust**.

I was instantly drawn to Rust's strict compiler, its focus on memory safety, and the security guarantees it offers. Unlike many languages, Rust forces developers to think deeply about ownership, lifetimes, and efficiency—traits that help avoid 70% of memory-related vulnerabilities common in other systems.

Despite its steep learning curve and slower compile times, Rust rewards its developers with **blazing-fast**, **predictable**, and **secure** software.

---

## 🧭 What’s Next?

I'm now focused on:

- Becoming a **professional Rust developer**
- Contributing to open-source Rust/blockchain projects
- Sharing my knowledge through **technical blogging**
- Building impactful and secure backend systems & dApps

I believe in building software that lasts, and in constantly evolving as a developer, teacher, and human.
